## 🔍 Quick Context (Start Here!)

**Before diving into this file, get recent changes:**
```bash
git log -5 --oneline --stat
```
This shows what changed since your last session (~1-3k tokens vs reading everything).

**Then proceed based on what you're working on.**

## 📁 Three-Tier Session Structure

This vault uses a **hierarchical session tracking system** for efficient context management:

### Tier 1: Vault Level (This File)
- **File:** `docs/docs-session-summary.md`
- **Content:** Vault organization, git workflow, documentation structure, multi-project work
- **When to use:** Working on vault structure, git setup, or multiple unrelated areas

### Tier 2: Projects Overview
- **File:** [projects/projects-session-summary.md](../projects/projects-session-summary.md)
- **Content:** Cross-project sessions, project-level organizational work
- **When to use:** Working on multiple related projects or project infrastructure

### Tier 3: Individual Projects
- [Project1 Sessions](../projects/Project1/Project1-session-summary.md) - Description
- [Project2 Sessions](../projects/Project2/Project2-session-summary.md) - Description
- *(Add your projects here)*

**📋 How It Works:**
- Sessions propagate UP: Tier 3 → Tier 2 → Tier 1
- Each tier contains complete context (detailed or summarized)
- Read the tier appropriate to your current work for efficient token usage
